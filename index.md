-   Creative practices are knowledge generating, though it might not be
    easy to articulate this knowledge through means other than the
    practice itself.

-   Arts practice research does not necessarily need to include a
    written component, but it often does.

-   The written component of the research can flow between a variety of
    modes, as dictated by the needs of the research itself.

-   Writing can be used in a traditional academic mode to provide
    analysis, explanation and context for the arts practice research, or
    to document a practice using an autoethnographic approach, or in a
    generative mode integral to the arts practice itself.

### Reflection

This article gives an overview of the place of writing in arts practice
research, both internationally and at the IWAMD. A central point of the
article is that the choice of how to use writing in arts practice
research need not be dictated by ideology, and can be informed by the
nature of the research itself. In light of this, that university
regulations stipulate a written element of 40,000 words for doctoral
arts practice research projects indicates that there is still room for a
greater acknowledgement of the value of epistemic practices in and of
themselves. From a practical point of view as student in the IWAMD it is
very useful to see how the institution itself frames the question of
writing for arts practice research, and to see examples of how other
researchers have used the written word in their work. The article
provides a great starting point for thinking about what place writing
might take in my own future research, and shows the value of
experimenting with different written modes to discover what is useful
(or not) in allowing my artistic research to contextualised, understood
and disseminated.

-   Following the author's multi-modal approach, a PaR project will
    include: a documented product (e.g. a performance captured on
    video), documentation of the artistic process, and a complementary
    written element.

-   This multi-modal approach allows access to the different forms of
    knowledge, such as know-how (tacit embodied knowledge), know-what
    (heuristic, tacit knowledge made explicit through critical
    reflection) and know-that (propositional knowledge).

-   Systematic critical reflection is a defining feature of PaR, and may
    differentiate it from arts practice outside the academy.

### Reflection

The author outlines adjustments that have had to be made on the part of
practitioners and institutions to enable Practice as Research (PaR) to
find its place as a recognised form of doctoral research in the UK.
Practitioners must be aware that all arts practice is not necessarily
research (as it is understood in the context of a university) and, to
enable arts practice research, universities must recognise arts practice
as a mode of knowledge production. The author's own approach to PaR
balances these considerations. His model of PaR is not necessarily what
might arise if one gave full acknowledgement to epistemological practice
as a means of knowledge production. It attempts to find a way of doing
PaR that can work within the institutional traditions of the university,
while also being acceptable to practitioners. This pragmatic approach
allows PaR to benefit from the institutional structures of universities,
which allow access to funding for research, provide accreditation and
enable knowledge to be disseminated. The author's multi-modal approach
to PaR (which includes many forms of documentation and written
components to complement the artistic output) aligns with the mission of
academia to share knowledge. The author also shows how this
multi-modality may well reflect the complex of activities that form the
artistic practice at the heart of the research, while also supporting
the authors conception of 'praxis' as cycle of
'doing-reflecting-reading-articulating-doing\' (Nelson 2013, pp.32). I
find that well-established ethnomusicological practice of thick
description give further credibility to this multi-modal approach.

-   The primacy of objective, positivist knowledge has been called into
    question throughout the last century, not least of all in the
    scientific disciplines from which that concept of knowledge
    initially emerged. This opens the door to other forms of knowledge
    being accepted as valid in academic research.

-   In place of objective truth we should strive to present knowledge in
    a situated, contextualised way, and reflexively expose the processes
    we use as researchers in constituting new knowledge.

-   Effective arts practice research rigorously relates the different
    forms of knowing (know-how, know-what, and know-that) to each other;
    each form of knowledge contextualises the others, aiding
    understanding and dissemination.

Reflection

An aim of the author is "confirming PaR as a valid arts research
methodology with a distinctive approach to rigour" (Nelson 2013, p.48),
and rigour is repeatedly emphasised as fundamental to PaR. Ironically,
the author is not so rigorous in explaining why rigour is so essential
to his conception of PaR; it is instead presented as a self-evident
truth: "Research in the arts needs, however, to demonstrate a rigour
equivalent to that of the sciences" (Nelson 2013, Chapter 3, p.39). His
point that it is the responsibility of each discipline to account for
"the rigour of its internal methods" (Nelson 2013, p.55) does at least
show that rigour is most properly defined in relation to a particular
research discipline. Nonetheless, perhaps critical reflection by Nelson
on the concept of rigour itself is warranted here.

I can see how, in most arts practice research contexts, rigour is
beneficial and desirable. However I think it would be especially useful
for arts practice research to consider values and yardsticks not
borrowed from traditional academic practices. Instead of **requiring**
arts practice research to be rigorous, should it not be allowed to
explore other ways of fruitfully navigating the unending sea of
knowledge? I find it hard to disagree with Nelson's pragmatic approach
to PaR, and I can see how it enables research practitioners to
productively engage with academic institutions. However, I feel that his
desire to make PaR "fit" with current institutional imperatives
precludes more radical forms of arts practice research, as he
acknowledges:

> I would find it difficult to advise, or even engage with, somebody who
> insisted that everything was intuitive (in the sense of inspired by a
> muse) since it would seem to place everything beyond pedagogy, indeed
> beyond analysis.
>
> (Nelson 2013, pp.63-64)

For me, a desire to be rigorous could steer the researcher towards a way
of searching for knowledge that is at odds with their arts practice.
Rigour might emphasise quantitative approaches over qualitative ones.
Again, I do accept that rigour is likely to be very important to the
vast majority of arts practice research; at the same time it would be
nice to leave the door open to other approaches, and accommodate the
most unruly of artists.

## Kinney, J. (1979) 'Classifying Heuristics', *College Composition and Communication*, 30(4), pp.351-356, available: <https://doi.org/10.2307/356710>.

-   A heuristic is a process used to search for a solution to a problem,
    in this case to write creatively. A heuristic need not necessarily
    be systematic.

-   The author identifies three styles of heuristic process: rational,
    empirical, and intuitive. Each of these relate respectively to
    different ways of knowing: through reasoning, through experience of
    the world, or through "non-linear immediate understanding" (Kinney
    1979, p.353, quoting Robert Ornstein).

-   Examples of intuitive heuristics are brainstorming, writing of
    free-association lists, concrete analogy, transcendental meditation,
    keeping a dream diary, and freewriting with a summing up.

-   The process of freewriting with summing up allows the creative
    person to alternate between states of "immersion" and "perspective",
    allowing an engagement with subconscious intuitive thinking to be
    used productively.

Quotes

1979, p.355):

### Reflection

Although a bit dated, this article provides a good starting point for me
to think about different types of heuristics and their uses in creative
practice. I had come across the concept of heuristics when studying
computer science, where it was described as a rule-of-thumb that could
narrow a large field of search. In the context of my own research, where
in some way I want to explore the space of all possible rhythms, I felt
the need for some method to narrow this (possibly infinite) conceptual
space. This would allow me to zone in on those rhythms that were humanly
possible and musically useful. The heuristic I hit upon was "movement":
instead of trying to think about abstract, one-dimensional rhythm
patterns and their articulation, I would think about what musically
useful movements were possible with that complex system made up of my
body, a stick, and a bodhrán. Using this heuristic of "musical movements
afforded by my body and instrument" I would follow the embodied,
extended logic of my body and instrument to find useful rhythms.
Kinney's division of heuristics into rational, empirical and intuitive
seems a bit brittle to me; the heuristic I have just described seems to
me to be rational, empirical and intuitive all at once. I did find that
the various examples of heuristics given by him resonated well with my
own experience, and the connection he makes between empiricism on one
hand, and doing, action, participation and sensation on the other, is
insightful.

McCaw, D. (2007) 'Taking Clive Seriously for a Moment', *New Theatre
Quarterly*, 23(4), 337--351.

-   Theatre games (as described in his 1977 book Theatre Games) were
    central to how Clive Barker helped actors learn to access body
    movement in a way that was conducive to his conception of physical
    theatre.

-   Theatre games allow actors to engage with a certain form of
    consciousness that allows performed movement to be responsive in a
    theatrical context, rather than being rehearsed, thought out or
    habitualised. Barker held that this approach to movement was
    essential to engage and communicate with an audience.

-   Although not always theoretically sound, Barker's methodology is
    largely in agreement more rigorous studies of the body, brain and
    movement (such the work done by Moshe Feldenkrais, and contemporary
    scientific study of the brain and body).

-   Barker's ideas could be developed if more consideration is given to
    recent work on the interdependence of body and mind, such as by
    Feldenkrais, Thomas Hanna and Antonio Damasio.

Reflection

When I read this article I was struck by how Barker's approach to
movement in theatrical performance resonated with my own idealised
conception of musical movement and interactivity in the context of Irish
traditional music. This idealised conception is not the only way of
thinking about movement and interactivity in the performance of Irish
traditional music, but I believe it is appropriate and useful. As a
thought experiment I began substituting "musician" for "actor", "tune"
for "game" and so on, when these terms arose in the article, allowing me
to imagine the ideas expressed in the context of my musical practice.
What emerged was an overarching goal of performing in an interactive
state of flow with one\'s collaborators and audience. Barker's use of
theatre games provided a structure for actors to explore this sort of
responsive, improvised, interactive movement in a way that could
subsequently be "carried over from playing the game into the rehearsal
of the play" (McCaw, 2007, p.341), and presumably on to actual
performance. I am especially interested in this aspect of the practice,
that it enables learning, rehearsal and performance all to flow into one
another. I wonder if there are parts of my practice that I could
conceive of as analogous to Barker's theatre games, and if I could
develop such "bodhrán games" with reference to the work of Barker,
Feldenkrais, Hanna, Damasio and others.

## Keil, C. (1995) 'The Theory of Participatory Discrepancies: A Progress Report', *Ethnomusicology*, 39(1), 1--19, available: <https://doi-org.proxy.lib.ul.ie/10.2307/852198>.

-   Keil's theory of Participatory Discrepancies was motivated by a
    desire to emphasise those processes of a shared musical performance,
    such as groove and texture, which are not well-accounted for in
    structural views of music, such as those common in the study of
    Western Art Music.

-   Participatory Discrepancies (referred to as "PDs") are perceptible,
    albeit minute, differences in execution between performing
    musicians, across any musical parameters such as rhythm, timbre, and
    pitch.

-   Embodying and apprehending PDs accounts for a large part of the
    appeal of music subcultures such rock, jazz, polka and many other
    traditions globally; they are central to creating the "vital drive"
    (Keil, 1995, p.1) of a participatory performance.

-   The author contends that PDs are learned, patterned, and measurable
    by objective electronic means.

### Reflection

Keil's style of writing is interesting to me, somewhat atypical of what
is found in much academic discourse. He is not afraid to express his
passion and zeal for a topic, and this paper in some respects feels like
a call to arms:

> Music is about process, not product; it\'s not seriousness and
> practice in deferring gratification but play and pleasure (French
> 1985) that we humans need from it \...
>
> (Keil 1995, p.1)

He seems to eschew direct definitions, instead giving a thick
description of his theory of participatory discrepancies in the form of
anecdotes, concrete example and impressionistic description. I found his
ideas hard to get a handle on at first, but ultimately I found this
approach to be nuanced and thought-provoking.

This theory seems to me to be a very powerful way of describing and
reasoning about the ephemeral processual structures that make social
musical performance so compelling for all participants, not least of all
with regard to Irish traditional music. The enlivening, complex sound
experience involved when musicians play with set dancers in a
traditional Irish context is particularly well-accounted for in the
theory of PD. It also relates directly to the current focus of my
bodhrán practice, where I am very literally getting my "hands on the
discrepancies, developing wrights or PD controlling skills" (Keil 1995,
p.11). And I do feel liberated!

Motor Structure as a Heuristic for the Development of Bodhrán
Expressivity

# Introduction

I began learning the bodhrán at about the age of twelve, over the summer
holidays in 1990. I was bought a bodhrán and stick, along with Mícheál Ó
Súilleabháin's tutor book (Ó Súilleabháin 1984); at that time bodhrán
wasn\'t taught formally, and so I learned myself. I played at home with
family, and later we went to sessions and played with others. In 1993 I
was placed first on bodhrán at Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann. Now, almost
thirty years later, I still play regularly in solitary practice, with
family and friends in pub and house sessions, and occasionally on stage.
I teach bodhrán and guitar, and over the years I have played guitar and
sung in rock, metal and folk bands in the Irish underground scene, as
well as professionally in wedding bands. I returned to third-level
education in 2016, studying bodhrán under Colm Murphy (of De Danann) at
UCC. More recently I have studied bodhrán with Jim Higgins at the Irish
World Academy of Music and Dance.

This arts practice research project attempts to evaluate the exploration
of motor structure (Baily and Driver 1992, p.63) as a means of
developing musical expression in my bodhrán playing. In this written
component of the research, I will contextualise my own playing within
current bodhrán performance practices, with reference to relevant
academic literature and online video resources. I will describe the
methods of my research, the data generated by the various research
modes, and discuss findings related to the research question that
emerged from analysis of that data. Hyperlinks to footage exemplifying
certain bodhrán performance practices are used throughout the text (and
collected in Appendices A and B), and the reader is encouraged to engage
with these.

# Bodhrán Performance Practices

Little is known about bodhrán performance practices prior to the
instrument's popularisation in the 1960s (Cunningham 1999, p.21).
Furthermore, Cunningham's research found that "there remains a
significant lack of published and unpublished academic work that deals
specifically with the performance styles of bodhrán playing" (Cunningham
1999, p.21), and over twenty years later, Harte similarly finds that
"despite a number of introductory pedagogical texts, the bodhrán has not
been fully explored in an ethnographic sense" (Harte 2020, p.2). Harte
highlights a shift from hand playing styles to the now more common use
of a stick as a beater (Harte 2020, p.23), but his text provides only
high-level descriptions of common playing practices on the instrument,
with no detailed analysis of the embodied rhythmic structures of bodhrán
playing.

Cunningham references five stick-playing styles identified by
professional player Tommy Hayes: 'Kerry Style', 'West Limerick Style',
'Waterford Style', 'Tambour Technique', and 'a style peculiar to Tommy
Hayes' (Cunningham 1999, p.22). Beyond identifying these playing styles
and describing the basic hand postures that differentiate them, detailed
description of their usage is given only in the case of 'Kerry Style'
(Cunnigham's thesis centers on detailed analysis of the playing of John
Joe Kelly, whose hand posture conforms to this style). Here and in his
later work, Cunningham acknowledges that

> Bodhrán performance cannot easily be categorised into different
> regional styles; it is more easily defined by referring to the manner
> of performance peculiar to an individual, or to a group of players.

(Cunningham 2011, p.72)

As suggested above by Cunningham, using regional styles to characterise
bodhrán playing technique is problematic; players from the same
geographical region often use different techniques, and same techniques
are shared across geographical regions. Here in Table 1, I offer a
translation of the five stick-playing styles mentioned, to concretely
reference well-known players who exemplify them.

**Table 1: Categorisation of bodhrán performance styles**

As described by Cunningham (1999, pp.21-23) the different playing styles
identified in Table 1 are differentiated by the particular way a player
grips the stick: what I term the 'grip posture'. My research explores
the particular movements of the stick in striking the bodhrán skin
afforded (Gibson 1977) by different grip postures, to evaluate a grip
posture's potential for unique musical expression.

My research approach is supported by the concept of "motor structure" as
developed by Baily and Driver:

> The way of playing a particular genre of music is characterised by
> certain patterns of movement that are specific to that style. These
> motor patterns, which in a sense \"lie behind\" the music, may be said
> to constitute the motor structure of that style. The motor structure
> consists of certain overlearned patterns of movement which are
> established by learning structurally related pieces that embody these
> patterns. (Baily 1977:329). **Fundamental to the motor structure of a
> style are certain basic postures and hand positions.** A given spatial
> layout may suggest quite different lines of musical development, each
> spatially logical in its own way. **Basic postures and hand positions

This research has resonances with other arts practice research which
directly consider the importance of movement in the context of creative
practice, such as Diane Daly's investigation into the effect of Dalcroze
Eurhythmics on her classical violin practice (Daly 2022), and Brendán de
Gallaí's work in the closely related field of Irish step dancing which
explored \"potential expressive possibilities in Irish step dancing and
address these possibilities through ... choreographic work" (de Gallai
2013, p.6).

# Research Method

This project uses an arts practice research methodology to investigate
the effect of using motor structure as a "heuristic" (Kinney, 1979) for
developing the expressive possibilities of the bodhrán. Arts practice
research (sometimes termed practice-as-research) is an academic research
discipline that "positions artistic practices at the centre of the
research endeavour" (Phelan and Nunan 2018, p.2). Arts practice research
acknowledges that "epistemic" (Phelan and Nunan 2018, p.10) creative
practice is itself knowledge-producing, and that this knowledge can be
communicated as research through a variety of modalities, including
through the arts practice itself, any appropriate documentation of that
arts practice, and in writing, as described in Robin Nelson's
multi-modal approach to practice-as-research (Nelson 2013, p.26). My
research question can perhaps only be answered through this type of arts
practice research; in exploring and evaluating the expressive
possibilities afforded by unusual motor structures of my bodhrán
playing, I must rely on my creative faculties and musical judgement in
the "doing-thinking\" of performance (Nelson 2013, p.61). Communication
of this embodied, embedded, enacted and extended knowledge (van der
Schyff et al. 2018, p.5) is well-served by Geertzian thick description
that uses autoethnographic journaling, video documentation and academic
writing.

As is evident in online video streaming and social media platforms (see
Appendix B: Unorthodox Bodhrán Motor Structures), a variety of different
motor structures (not limited to the five styles referenced above) are
used by bodhrán players to construct the distinctive motor grammars of
their playing style. As I have shown, this variety of motor structure is
not described in detail in the sparse academic literature, perhaps
unsurprisingly given that the very large majority of players seem to
rely exclusively on the particular motor structures popularised by
Peadar Mercier, and developed in turn by Johnny "Ringo" McDonagh, John
Joe Kelly and the current younger generation of bodhrán players (see
Appendix A: Orthodox Bodhrán Motor Structures).

Despite the theoretical possibility for unique expression afforded by
the motor structures of a given grip posture, there is some truth to
Cunningham's assertion that:

> In all bodhrán styles the player's rhythmic repertoire comprises 'down
> strokes', 'up strokes', 'doubling' or 'trebling' and combinations of
> each.
>
> (Cunningham 2011, p.72)

That is, no matter which grip posture is used, the rhythmic patterns
generated by each are equivalent in some abstract sense. This brings us
to the crux of my research question: exactly what expressive
possibilities can be developed by exploring the motor structures of
different grip postures afforded by a bodhrán stick? Up until recently,
my own playing could be described as sitting squarely in the Peadar
Mercier lineage, also incorporating a particular adjustment of this grip
posture taught to me by Colm Murphy. In attempting to answer my research
question I incorporated the more obscure Sean Ó Riada grip posture into
my playing, to see what (if any) unique musical expression it affords.

# Motor Structure and Expressivity in Bodhrán Playing

To research the development of musical expressivity afforded by
embodying unusual motor structures in my bodhrán playing, I dedicated a
daily session of practice to focus on a particular grip posture, which I
term ['the Ó Riada
grip'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6sw4ozuuiI&t=3396s) (Brian
Sheehan 2022, Clip 14). Eamonn De Buitléar (associated with Ó Riada's
seminal ensemble Ceoltóirí Chualann, Bradley 2011, p.121) can be seen
performing this motor structure: <https://youtu.be/2VjkR9GNqwo?t=19>
(Pedro Fernández García, 2008). Exploration of this grip posture quickly
extended to include another closely related posture which I term
['Tommy-meets-Colm\'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6sw4ozuuiI&t=259s)
(Brian Sheehan 2022, Clip 3). These sessions (usually about an hour in
length) included unaccompanied playing, playing to recorded music
sources, targeted video documentation of my playing, and journal
writing. Journal entries gave a broad account of the activities of a
session, as well as my reflections on those activities. Between February
21st and March 18th, eighteen bodhrán practice sessions generated two
data sets: eighteen one-to-two-page journal entries, and approximately
thirty-four short video clips totalling just under two hours of footage
(Brian Sheehan 2022,
[available](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6sw4ozuuiI) on YouTube
unedited and indexed by clip number).

I performed a thematic analysis (See Appendix C) of my journal entries
by selecting recurrent, related words ('codes'), grouping these codes
into clusters, and finally, identifying themes that emerged from these
code clusters when taken in the overall context of the research process.
Themes that emerged from this analysis were: 'development of
nomenclature'; 'rhythmic nuance'; and 'switching between grip postures'.
These three themes are discussed below, with reference to relevant video
clips of my practice.

## Development of Nomenclature 

An unforeseen insight that emerged from this research was the value of
developing succinct yet information-rich ways of verbally describing the
embodied motor structures of bodhrán performance practice, which is as
yet underdeveloped in the academic literature.

Rather than tying myself in knots trying to verbally describe complex
three-dimensional musculoskeletal movements of the bodhrán-playing body,
a convenient strategy emerged almost immediately in my journal writing.
In my first journal entry (21/02/22), I used the term 'Colm Murphy grip'
to denote [the way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iUNZ5YJVXA) (Conor
O\' Sullivan 2020) Colm taught me to hold a bodhrán stick. This way of
identifying bodhrán techniques with reference to their well-known
exemplars has been a feature of my conversations with bodhrán-playing
friends, and with my tutor at the Irish World Music Academy, Jim
Higgins. During lessons with Jim, we would frequently refer to "the way"
a particular well-known player might execute a technique; techniques
were exemplified with reference to Johnny "Ringo" McDonagh, Tommy Hayes
or Dónal Lunny for example. For someone familiar with bodhrán playing,
evoking these names indexes a wealth of information about diverse
aspects of these individuals' playing styles. For someone not so
familiar with bodhrán playing, these names can be used to [access
secondary sources](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmQmpwrA_UM) (as is
encouraged throughout this text), such as online video archives, to
develop an audio-visual understanding the performance parameters in
question. In this way, the language construct of a musician's name
indexes and is contextualised by first- and second-hand audio-visual
knowledge of that player's embodied techniques.

In my journal entries, I developed a shorthand for identifying grip
postures based on this idea, and so many entries contain references to
'Colm Murphy grip' (or just 'Colm'), ['Ó Riada
grip'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6sw4ozuuiI&t=3396s), 'Tommy
grip' (after Tommy Hayes), 'Ringo' (after Johnny "Ringo" McDonagh). This
idea is further extended in my second (22/02/22) and third (23/02/22)
entries, where I begin to use the term
['Tommy-meets-Colm'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6sw4ozuuiI&t=259s)
to denote a certain grip posture that can be seen as a hybrid of the
Tommy and Colm grips, and is also quite similar to the Ó Riada grip.

## Rhythmic Nuance

The abstract concept of a quaver rhythm at a given tempo can be embodied
in practice using, for example, either the Colm grip or the Ó Riada
grip. However, that is not to say that both articulations are
equivalent. An important finding of this research project is that the
different motor structures I explored express the same abstract rhythm
in different, albeit nuanced, musically useful ways. Consideration of
this question arose frequently in journal entries, such as here:

> I keep questioning whether this method is actually creating anything
> new. This method being, the exploration of different grips and
> consequent stick movements and drum orientations.
>
> \[\...\]
>
> Sometimes the difference is slight, but maybe something comparable to
> playing near the bridge or nearer the fingerboard on a fiddle. (sur
> pont Vs sur tasto?)

(Journal Entry 15, 15/03/22)

To convince myself that there is a valid musical reason for using the
motor structures of the Ó Riada grip, I [directly
contrasted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6sw4ozuuiI&t=5719s) (Brian
Sheehan 2020, Clip 26) this posture with the Colm grip in performance,
eventually concluding that they do in fact express the same abstract
pattern differently:

> I recorded an example of this \[a slide pattern that switches between
> Ó Riada and Colm grips\], and the equivalent articulation of this
> pattern in Colm alone for comparison. They are **same but different**.
> Playing it all in Colm grip sound \[sic\] flatter, more even, more
> consistent.
>
> \[\...\] Ó Riada adds a "wavering" unevenness to the phrase.

(Journal entry 16, 16/03/22)

Switching between Grip Postures

Overlapping with the above question of evaluating the unique rhythmic
nuances afforded by the motor structures of the Ó Riada grip, the theme
of 'switching between grip postures' was very evident in my journal
entries. Given that the difference of articulation between the motor
structures of the Colm grip and those of the Ó Riada grip (or the
related Tommy-meets-Colm grip) tend toward slight rather than being
extremely pronounced, it was found that these differences could be shown
most effectively (and so, be used in the service of musical expression)
when they are juxtaposed directly in performance as above. In this way,
musical expressivity is not only found within one motor structure or the
other, but also emerges in the discrepancies between them. In practice,
this switching of postures can happen from bar to bar, or even within
the bar. Early in the research I noted that "The feeling of exploring
these grip transitions and the different textures created by each are
very satisfying" (Journal entry 4, 24/02/22)

[It was found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6sw4ozuuiI&t=1329s)
(Brian Sheehan 2022, Clip 6) that the switching of grip postures maps
naturally onto the binary call-and-response phrase structure
characteristic of Irish traditional dance music, where "melodic
structures in this repertoire are largely constructed from bar-length
motives to create 2-bar sub-phrases, 4-bar phrases, and 8- bar parts"
(Doherty 2022, p.22). It also echoes the weight-shifting dynamic created
by the bilaterally symmetrical steps of Irish traditional dancers:

> I ended up trying to switch between Colm and Tommy-meets-Colm (TmC?)
> every bar. I like how this agrees with the natural phrasing of the
> tunes and echos the weight shift of dance steps from left foot to
> right foot.

(Journal entry 5, 25/02/22)

# Conclusion

In this written component of my arts practice research project, I used
the concept of motor structure (Baily and Driver, 1992, p.63) to compare
bodhrán performance practices which use a stick. By analysing existing
performance practices in this way, I explained the motivation of this
research to explore the 'Ó Riada' grip posture as a possible means of
developing expressivity in my playing. I followed Nelson's multi-modal
approach to arts practice research (Nelson 2013) to produce and analyse
two datasets: video clips, and journal entries which documented my daily
practice.

My research found that a useful, succinct nomenclature for bodhrán stick
"grip postures" can be developed by using the names of well-known
exemplars to reference their corresponding grip postures. It found that
musically-useful differences in articulation were evident when the same
abstract rhythm was articulated with different grip postures; in
particular, a difference in articulation was shown between the "Colm
Murphy" grip posture and the "Ó Riada" grip posture in my own
performance practice. Finally, it found that this difference in
articulation can be further exploited for musical ends when grip
postures are directly juxtaposed in performance; I taught myself to
"switch between grip postures" to achieve a textural effect that can be
used very effectively to express the nested symmetrical phrase structure
of Irish traditional dance music in a unique, novel way.

It is perhaps this last finding that is the most significant
contribution to the embodied knowledge of bodhrán playing. Although I
found examples in the literature, and in common practice, of musicians
using a variety of grip postures to construct their playing style, each
player tends to use only one grip posture in their playing. This arts
practice research shows that it is possible to switch between grip
postures in the moment of performance, allowing a new palette of
textures to emerge from a bodhrán player's intelligent (Nelson 2013,
p.40) use of movement in performance practice.
